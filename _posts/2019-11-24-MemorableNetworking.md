Networking has never been about deep conversations.<span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold"> The purpose is to get the next meeting by leaving a good first impression.</span> Those subsequent content meetings are what matter.

I go to a lot of those events these days, and while I still don't particularly like to sell-pitch myself on loop, I recognize the importance of meeting new contacts.

When I engage in a new conversation, I try to follow two rules to ensure that 1) I make a good impression and 2) I am memorable beyond the 1000 people this person has already seen today.

<span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">Offer stories and a smooth conversation-baton-handover. </span><br>
When people ask where you are from, don’t answer with a one word reply like <em>Munich</em>. It’s hard to keep such a conversation flowing.

Instead, go for a story like <em>I’m from Munich..., and to me it’s a bit like The Shire from Lord of The Rings. It’s idyllic, you see many bearded, round-belly Bavarians happily strolling around with beer jugs in their hands...</em>And there you go.

You get a chuckle and give an opportunity for the other person to take up that baton.

<span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">Actively seek similarities.</span><br>
I found myself at a pretty dry airline event where RFID bag tags where THE next big tech. I bumped into a guy who worked in an innovation lab for an airline. He turned out to be an ex-Uber product guy who visibly exhaled, when I shared that I was also not an airline person and come from the tech world. We immediately hit it off.

At the end, <span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">human beings <em>deeply</em> crave for stories and for a sense of belonging. </span>Give them that and you will be naturally more memorable and likeable.

It actually also works in social settings, ie when you are meeting the friends or parents of your partner for the first time.
