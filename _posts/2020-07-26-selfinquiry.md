<br>
The book is called<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reboot.io/book/" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">Reboot: Leadership and the Art of Growing Up</a></em>&nbsp;by Jerry Colonna, who is a start-up CEO coach. The premise of the book is that you can only fully achieve your potential as a leader, if you <em><span style="color:#d40202"><strong>"sort through the emotional baggage that is holding you back professionally, and even more important, in your relationships."</strong></span></em>

So I sat down with myself and started answering some of the questions the book poses to me, and ladies, I cannot tell you how <em>mind-opening</em> it was to make some of those subconscious undercurrents more conscious to myself.<br>
<br>
Here were some of the questions and the most honest answers I could verbalize.<br>
<br>
<strong>In what ways do I deplete myself and run myself into the ground?</strong>

<div><em>I run myself down by being overly busy, by putting too many meetings into my day. I <strong><span style="color:#d40202">seek meaning</span></strong> <span style="color:#d40202"><strong>through being busy</strong></span> and through my many hobbies and side projects, but by doing so, I wonder, whether I <span style="color:#d40202"><strong>actually</strong></span> <span style="color:#d40202"><strong>live</strong></span>, or whether I am just living up to the expectations of my to-do list and schedule.</em><br>
&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Where am I running from and where to?</strong></div>

<div><em>I am running away from pain. I am running away from commitment, because commitment means to make myself vulnerable (and to risk&nbsp;getting hurt).<br>
I am running towards happiness and stability,&nbsp;but <span style="color:#d40202"><strong>I recognize that in order to be happy I need to open up and let people in and rely on them.</strong></span></em><br>
&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Why have I allowed myself to be so exhausted?</strong></div>

<div><em>Because only in a state of exhaustion, I cannot flee anymore from my pain and it is when I start to reflect and face reality...</em><br>
<br>
Verbalizing those thoughts&nbsp;makes me realize that&nbsp;a lot of my decision making, such as moving cities&nbsp;and traveling, have been <span style="color:#d40202"><strong>mechanisms to avoid feeling pain or getting hurt</strong></span>. The original pain sits deep and resulted&nbsp;from the loss of my father to cancer many years ago and pain aovidance has ever since been a personal demon of mine.<br>
<br>
One sentence that very much resonated with me from the book was this line here:<br>
&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-size:14px"><em><span style="color:#d40202"><strong>"By not standing still, I was able to be the object of everyone else’s projections of who and what I should be. Too busy to live my own life, I took direction from the affirmations of others."</strong></span></em></span><br>
<br>
While everyone will answer differently to the questions in the book, for me, it was tremendously helpful to realize that<span style="color:#d40202"> <strong>I have to stop running away and sit still with my pain and work through it, rather than to flee from it and avoid it.&nbsp;</strong></span>The book was very timely and if you choose to read it, I hope that i can also help you with your own personal baggage.<br>
<br>
Some other powerful lines from the book&nbsp;I want to share and that play&nbsp;along the same theme described here are:</div>

<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:14px"><em>"In the space between our memories and the stories we create about ourselves, we live our lives."<br>
<br>
"Learning to lead yourself is hard because we are wired to look outward. We feel pain and we look up and out to see who’s hurt"<br>
<br>
"The common denominator in all our struggles is always people."</em></span></div></p>
