The only time in the day we can reliably control is our morning.

Then messaging apps, the boss, social obligations & #fomo come crashing on us. Lately, I have become much more protective of Me time and aware of how I want my mornings to be.

Two overarching themes dominate my morning
1) Take care of myself (Body + Mind)
2) Be creative (Write + Reflect).

A typical morning looks like this for me:

I also try to get work done in the morning and preferably schedule meetings into the afternoon, because I found my mind much clearer in the morning. 
 
<span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold"> Routines are useless if you <em>cannot</em> follow them (ie too ambitious).</span> It has taken me some iterations and I mainly stick to routines during the week, giving me some slack and flexibility on the weekend. <span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold"> The key is to start small and iterate and build on what really works for you.</span>

What holds me accountable is a simple excel checklist. It's stupid, I know, but it works quite well. :)

I found that a more <em>aware</em> morning routine gives me a lot of stability and energy for the day ahead and just puts me into a better position to tackle work.

What is your secret weapon in the morning? :)
