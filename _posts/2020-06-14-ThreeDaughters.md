 <span style="color: #202020;font-family: helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;font-size: 16px;"> 
 It captivates&nbsp;me, because it is told from an individual perspective and brings color to&nbsp;the corrupt imperial time ( -1911), the chaotic warlord time (1916-1928), the brutal time under the Kuoming Dang and the Communist Party during Japanese occupation (1937-1945) over to eventually the&nbsp;Mao and Post-Mao era (1945 - ) </span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #202020;font-family: helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;I had little idea of what an emotional, restless <em>recent</em>&nbsp;history China had and the book leaves me dumpstruck.<br>
<br>
While naturally I have a strong personal interest in the matter, I do believe it is worthwhile reading it for anyone who is interested in <em>current affairs</em> with China, from an economic or geopolitical point of view&nbsp;</span>― I find that <span style="color:#d40202"><strong>there are a lot of elements in this book that help explain the mentality of Modern Chinese people and <em>why they think the way they do</em></strong></span><em>.</em><br>
<br>
<!--more--><span style="color: #202020;font-family: helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;font-size: 16px;">For me personally, it resonates deeply for two reasons:<br>
<br>
First, I realize that my parents and grandparents were directly living through the different times of China and how all of those socio-economic factors have shaped their thinking and values systems today. Through this book, I feel much closer to <em>where they are coming from</em>.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #202020;font-family: helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif;font-size: 16px;">My mum, for example, would always criticize me. As a child growing up in German, I disliked her for not saying anything nice to me like all the other German parents would do. Having read the book now, I understand that self-criticism and criticizing other people at length was part of Mao's ideology to "clean" yourself and keep order. Could her behavior towards me be explained by her own upbringing in a (self-) criticizing society?<br>
<br>
It certainly sparks my <em>curiosity</em> to learn more about my parents and grand-parents own experiences when they grew up.<br>
<br>
Second, business and societal practices and habits seem to have roots in history. For exmaple, the concept of <em>saving face</em>&nbsp;is deeply Chinese. After reading the book, I wonder whether the concept stems from the <em>Great Leap Forward</em>. The time where an "economic leap" was to be achieved through industrialization and steel production which eventually disguised a deep economic regression and left many people dead due to economic mismanagement and famine.<br>
<br>
People were in denial, partially because they couldn't criticize the system and partially to guard their <em>face</em> which led to people not <em>only ignoring economic misconducts but more importantly exaggerating and praising those</em>. Apparently, it got to a point where the book describes the atmosphere as "doublespeak": one thinks something and says something else (referencing George Orwell's 1984).</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:16px">Of course those are just my personal thoughts. This book leaves me in awe, because having lived in China for the past four years, I have come across a very Modern, a very fast-paced and digitized Chinese nation, and yet it is so interesting to me to see how elements of history and traditions still shine through in the fabric of people's thoughts&nbsp;― as it is certainly the case for any modern nation and their history.</span></p>
