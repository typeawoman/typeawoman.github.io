Should you pay or not on a (first or second) date? I always feel&nbsp;<em>obligated</em> to offer at least.<br>

After all, I earn enough, my guy friends always complain about being <em>exploited</em>&nbsp;on dates, and somehow, paying gives me a feeling of being <em>equal</em>.<br>

A friend of mine provides a very different view on thi<!--more-->: She says, <span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">men want to feel like men, it is a matter of principles</span>. She always lets the guy pay without politely offering to chime in. She argues that it&nbsp;validates the guy's Stone Age instinct of being the provider.<em>&nbsp;</em>Her advice: <span style="color:#d40202;font-weight: bold">Be nice, smile, and&nbsp;say thank you after.</span><br>

First, I dismissed this thought. Then it creeped back on me...We all have strong opinions and we can take care of ourselves, but hey, secretly all of us want to have a shoulder to lean on, right?&nbsp;By offering to pay my share on a date, I seem to signal to the guy that I can take care of myself,<span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">I am strong</span>. I don't need you.

What am I trying to proof with paying? Let the guy be the guy. See if he bites and if he gets grumpy about paying, well perhaps it is a sign that he is not a good future (caring) partner anyways.
