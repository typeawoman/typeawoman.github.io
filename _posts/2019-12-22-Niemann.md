This week I got really inspired by <a href="https://www.christophniemann.com/" style="color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">C. Niemann</a>. He is a Berlin-based illustrator that has done work for The New Yorker,  MoMa and NatGeo. His illustrations are brilliant, smart and simple. If you don't know him already - there is a great documentary on Netflix called <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80057883" style="color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Abstract</a> about him.

Enjoy some selected pieces :) All Â© Christoph Niemann
