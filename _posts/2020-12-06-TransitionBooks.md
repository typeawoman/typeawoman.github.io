</ul>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;padding: 0;mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #202020;font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">I am currently reading <em>The First 90 Days by Watkins</em> and I am so <span style="color:#d40202"><strong>grateful</strong></span> to have discovered this book as I transition into my new role. It has become <span style="color:#d40202"><strong>my bible and manual </strong></span>and I can only warmly recommend it to anyone who is going through a period of transition in their career (new job, new role, new team etc.).</p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;padding: 0;mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #202020;font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><span style="color:#d40202"><strong>First impressions matter </strong></span>and so the first 90 days in a new role set the tone of yourself, your brand and your reputation in the new team or company going forward. The book helps to structure those first three months, reminding us to approach each phase with a set of goals and the things we should accomplish or avoid doing.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
For example, it reminded me&nbsp;to pick out <span style="color:#d40202"><strong>culture interpreters</strong></span>, people who can help us to quickly get a grasp on the company's&nbsp;culture. It also reminded me to engage and nurture peers around me, like with your neighbors, you don't want to piss them off ;)<br>
<br>
Moreover, the book&nbsp;made me realize&nbsp;<span style="color:#d40202"><strong>to not go in with an "action bias"</strong></span>—to believe that I knew better and overthrow all existing norms without having listened. The book gently compares the consequences<span style="color:#d40202"><strong>&nbsp;to a body rejecting a donor organ</strong></span>. I think the image very much sticks with me and I am taking my time in 1on1s to understand the company better before I form my judgement.<br>
<br>
Just two days ago, the book reminded me to <span style="color:#d40202"><strong>NOT STAY AWAY from my boss</strong></span>. Indeed, it had been 3 weeks I hadn't heard from her and the book adviced that it was <span style="color:#d40202"><strong>MY JOB to foster a positive relationship </strong></span>with my boss not the other way around and to seek five conversations in the transition period: 1.&nbsp;The situational assessment, 2.&nbsp;The expectation conversation, 3.&nbsp;The resources conversation, 4.&nbsp;The style of working conversation and last but not least the 5. Growth and development conversation.<br>
I think it is so so true and I am eager and planning to follow up on those.<br>
<br>
Again, I think you all get what I mean—the book is <span style="color:#d40202"><strong>gold</strong></span>. Honestly!&nbsp;And applicable to so many situations. See for yourself.</p>
