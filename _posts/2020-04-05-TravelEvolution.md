<br>
It has been such a learning curve for me to see and be part of the&nbsp;crisis management in an airline&nbsp;during Covid. More than 90% of revenue of an airline are typically generated by selling flight tickets -- that's billions of dollars generated&nbsp;every&nbsp;single <em>month</em> which are slashed now.&nbsp;Moreover, perhaps due to shareholder pressure on having to be more focused and&nbsp;efficient on the core business, airlines have <em>hardly ever </em>diversified their business to other financially meaningful business streams. Oh shit.<br>
<br>
With zero demand, zero sales, how do you stay alive?<!--more--> Can you&nbsp;turn around things, become nimble and come up with alternative revenue streams? Interestingly, for a start-up, pivoting its business model to market response is a <em>daily drill</em>. For&nbsp;airlines, which have enjoyed an almost monopoly status on transporting people from one country to another for too long, </span></span></span><span style="color:#d40202"><span style="font-family:helvetica neue,helvetica,arial,verdana,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>now is the painful time to start thinking and acting like a start-up.</strong></span></span></span><br>

What is the Uber-equivalent of air travel? How can we leverage even more existing airline assets (=planes) and build services on top of them? Against all <em>current</em> beliefs, will we see more creative and innovative travel start-ups emerging? How else could we move people from A to B given current technology limitations? Do we even want to still travel and how do we want to travel?<br>

Reply me, I am curious to hear your thoughts. :)</span></span></span></p>
