I am using a few tools to keep me, structured, focused and productive. I would be curious to hear about your hacks here.

Evernote - I switch between Evernote and Notes on Mac devices. Any long form text I typically type on Evernote (such as journals, write ups for this newsletter), any to do's or quick notes I write down on Notes. I generally like Evernote as a light-weight note taking tool.

Whereby - I really start to love this video conferencing tool. No dial-ins, no downloads, no hiccups. You have a virtual room, and you share the link with the other party. That's it - great for remote work.

Google Photos - My photo library. I like the powerful image-recognition feature to search text to image. I wished Adobe Lightroom, which I use for my photography would be as light-weight and less cumbersome.<!--more-->

WhatsApp and WeChat - I use both a lot for work, and I find communication with colleagues, clients and others much more efficient than a cumbersome e-mail or slack, as they are used to check their WhatsApps/WeChats all the time for private messages. I also really love voice messages - unlike trying to schedule calls (especially across time zones), it is an easy way to convey long, complicated messages and you can get the tone and mood across.

Ironically, I have turned off my WhatsApp and WeChat notification in order to NOT check my messages all the time and stay focused. I allocate 30 minutes in my day to swift through all my messages and text.

Google Drive - I don't like it. Mainly the user interface and it takes me 2 steps too many to find the file I am looking for. I would be delighted to learn about a better system (I don't think Dropbox is that much better).

The one productivity "tool" that I have really enjoyed in the last few weeks is playing chess. It makes me think about being 3 steps ahead and about what other people will do next or how they think.
