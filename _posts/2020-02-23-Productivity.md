For being more productive in our every day, we use tools and hacks to structure, manage and get order into our lives. Here are some that I use day to day or cannot live without and I would love to hear about yours, as I am always open to discover new tools. :) <!--more-->

<span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold"><a href="https://evernote.com/intl/de/" style="color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Evernote</a></span> - I use Evernote for long-form typing and really appreciate its easy, mobile and clean design. I pretty much use it every day for reflection and journal writing.

<span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">Moleskine/Notes</span> - I used to rely heavily on Wunderlist for to dos, but ever since it got bought by Microsoft I reverted back to good old Moleskine <a href="https://us.moleskine.com/volant-journal-black/p0413" style="color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">notebook</a> for jotting down to dos and notes. I also use Notes on my iPhone for to dos.

<span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold"><a href="https://whereby.com/" style="color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Whereby</a></span> - This is by far the easiest and most intuitive video conferencing tool I have come across. No dial-ins, no downloads, no hiccups. You have a virtual room, and you share the link with the other party. That's it - great for remote work.

<span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold"><a href="https://www.google.com/photos/about/" style="color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Google Photos</a></span> - I like the powerful image-recognition feature to search text-to-image. Best way to find "passports", "presentation", "love" - try it :)

<span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">WhatsApp and WeChat</span> - I use both a lot for work, and I find communication with colleagues, clients and others much more efficient than e-mail or slack, because they are typically more responsive on chat.

More importantly, I have started to use <span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">voice messages</span> as a way to convey complicated things much more efficiently - and you get to hear more contextual information such as tone and mood in a voice message.

Ironically, I have turned off my WhatsApp and WeChat notification in order to NOT check my messages all the time and stay focused. I allocate 30 minutes in my day to swift through all my messages and text.

<span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">Google Drive</span> - I don't like it. I unfortunately have to use it every day. I appreciate the team/sharing function, but I really dislike the interface and I also don't like that I never know about recent file changes. Any other tools or tips, ladies?

<span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">Playing chess</span> - Last, the one productivity "tool" that I have really enjoyed in the last few weeks is playing chess online during my cab rides. I've noticed that I started using a "chess mindset" at work too, trying to sense what my opposite will do three steps ahead.
