Some people have asked me whether I made New Year's resolutions, and while I have no active bucket list, I did write down routines I'd like to adopt in 2020. 

Some thoughts on the routines below: 

I try to keep Sunday evenings free of dates or any social obligations in order to get a good full 8-9 hours sleep and start the new week fresh. It's bad to drink on Sundays and feel hungover by Mondays...

I'm having most difficulties with adopting to my new food routines - I've been following the whole vegan vs. performance conversations, and still don't know if it's better to go vegan, or low carb or keto or whatever is the current <em>truth</em>. I try to remind myself to go meatless on Mondays and no sweets/sugar on Tuesday as an initial attempt to <em>eat healthier</em>. I have yet to pick up those routines though...

Otherwise, I try to be <span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">more kind</span> this year and offering my help more often. Perhaps it's karma, but I feel like there is something about <em>paying forward</em>. So while before I would ignore most of it, now, I try to at least write back to the MBA kids that reach out on LinkedIn for help.<!--more-->
