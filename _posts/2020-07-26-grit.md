<br>
<em>Rollercoaster</em>, <em>ups and downs</em>... these expressions really don’t do it justice.<br>
<br>
The highs have been <em>ecstatic</em>, the lows brought me to places where I didn’t recognize myself: At one point my&nbsp;co-founder and I were really struggling. “This is what a looming divorce must feel like” I thought. When I tried to </span></font><em><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">pick myself up</span></font></em><font color="#202020" face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">, I just felt stress, tiredness and sadness...<br>
<br>
Some thoughts &amp; tools I came across that helped me a lot<!--more-->:<br>
<br>
<strong>Recognizing there’s a time to be sad/down/angry</strong><br>
I believe that we all&nbsp;have a ton of grit, energy and motivation, but I also believe that at times</span></font><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"> the best thing we can do for ourselves is</span></font><span style="color:#d40202"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong> just to recognize and accept that things are tough</strong></span></font></span><font color="#202020" face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">. Because that’s the only way we’ll start doing the right things to address it.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Remembering &amp; visualizing the why</strong><br>
During the down phases, I would question&nbsp;why I'm doing all of this (=build my company) and whether I should be doing it at all. </span></font><span style="color:#d40202"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>After all, following my dream should feel great, no? </strong></span></font></span><br>
<br>
<font color="#202020" face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Then I started to visualize the “why” behind wanting to build a company</span></font>—<font color="#202020" face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">and things changed. I imagined myself working with my future teams &amp;&nbsp;customers,&nbsp;interacting with the world in new ways through the company’s product, being able to create new patterns through my company's culture and having female leaders in tech</span></font>—<font color="#202020" face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Visualizing the future I wanted to create&nbsp;gave me </span></font><span style="color:#d40202"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>the required adrenaline and energy that were stronger than the stress and negativity of my current situation.</strong></span></font></span><br>
<br>
<font color="#202020" face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Getting help</strong><br>
I started by openly telling friends during meetups that things are really tough. It didn’t help. The “I’m sorry to hear that” and “here’s one sentence of advice” was not what I needed. It was </span></font><span style="color:#d40202"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>real attention, real problem-solving and taking people’s time to talk about myself</strong></span></font></span><font color="#202020" face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"> - maybe for hours. </span></font><em><span style="color:#d40202"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>Asking for it didn’t come naturally to me.</strong></span></font></span></em><br>
<br>
<font color="#202020" face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">A friend ended up proactively offering/insisting to meet for coffee</span></font>—<font color="#202020" face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">specifically to talk things through. Plus, I invested 3 hours in talking to a life coach over 4 weeks. It worked as it helped me </span></font><span style="color:#d40202"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong>form new thoughts about &amp; reframe my situation in a way I wasn't able to myself</strong></span></font></span><font color="#202020" face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">. For example, I realized that my path forward was not binary (be left with nothing or make everything work, but I had many options in between that I felt good about (surprise :D).<br>
<br>
<strong>Trying some life coaching techniques</strong></span></font></p>

<ul>
	<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Identify stressful thoughts </strong>such as<em>&nbsp;I'm running behind, I should have already found a co-founder, already have decided on an idea.</em>&nbsp;Say them out loud, right them down. Stopping to “ignore” them helps already. My life coach also got me to challenge whether they are true - in what way could I be wrong about them? Is it really so bad, if my worst fear comes true?<strong> Most of my stressful thoughts were not “true”, but I had made myself believe in them.</strong></span></li>
	<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size:14px"><font color="#202020" face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><strong>Think about the big picture:</strong> What else is stressing you? Everything is connected: Work, love, health,... all affect how we feel. In my case, I realized that I had been putting some personal admin things and a date off and these&nbsp;were also stressful <em>other</em> things I wasted energy on ignoring.</font></span></li>
	<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size:14px"><font color="#202020" face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><strong>Ask yourself an annoying question</strong>: In what way could my situation be perfect? My life coach “forced” me to come up with an entire list of things, which helped me see my situation in a weirdly positive light. For example, my current situation could be seen as a learning opportunity where I learn&nbsp;</font></span><span style="font-size:14px"><font color="#202020" face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif">things that will be powerful in the future, even though maybe I cannot yet grasp that now. </font></span></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;padding: 0;mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #202020;font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><font color="#202020" face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Some of these things may seem&nbsp;obvious, but in my darkest hours, they helped me get to a better mental state, where</span></font><span style="color:#d40202"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"> <strong>I was more recentered and grounded</strong></span></font></span><font color="#202020" face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"> to face challenges.<br>
<br>
On company building: By now I have accepted that especially the first phase - when uncertainty is highest and we have to figure EVERYTHING out, this is just the deal.</span></font><span style="color:#d40202"><font face="helvetica neue, helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px"><strong> As entrepreneurs, we bet on the “ups”. The price we pay is the possibility of the “downs” and it helps to have some tools to deal with them.</strong></span></font></span></p>
