A while ago, I read the book upon recommendation and it really changed my thinking (I uploaded the book <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lbAno5E5vhaEClyS3ETb-XfoTZdp1shq/view?usp=drive_open" style="color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">here</a> for you). In one of the earlier newsletter, I wrote about <a href="https://typeawoman.github.io/Morningroutine/" style="color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">my morning habits</a> and it was a lot inspired by what I read.

James argues in his book that people don't stick to good habits and continue with bad habits. Why is that? It is because bad habits typically are easier, more available and give you instant gratification (think about eating chocolate, you only get fat later).

Good habits though tend to be "painful" at first to only get gratification later (think about going to the gym, you won't see anything tomorrow, but only in one month when you continue the good habit).

He continues to say that an effective way to foster good habits is to think of the person that does the good habit and put yourself into this mindset. You want to run a marathon? A runner runs, right? He runs every day and because of this routine the <em>consequence is that he can run a marathon.</em><span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold"> It is not the goal but the consequence.</span>

There are some more interesting concepts he elaborates in the book. As we start a new decade, I am sure a lot of you have also thought about new routines and habits and goals to tackle for the new year. I want to amplify your energy and hope the book will help you. :)

For those impatient once, here is also a fantastic <a href="https://hbr.org/ideacast/2019/12/the-right-way-to-form-new-habits" style="color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">podcast</a> where he speaks to Harvard Business Review about his book and pretty much summarizes his core theses. Listening in for 5 minutes already will shift your mind!
