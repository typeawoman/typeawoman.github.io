Have you ever thought about becoming a millionaire before?

It was never on my bucket list. I grew up in an environment where being rich was frowned upon. So, I never actively strove for money, and instead dedicated myself to more noble goals like traveling and learning.

But wait. <span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">Why not?</span><!--more-->

Besides accepting those established social values around me, personally, <span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">it never occured to me</span> that I <em>could</em> become a millionaire. This always seemed like something <em>other</em> people (predominantly male?) achieved. <span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">I never even tried striving for it.</span>

My entepreneurial ventures have started to question this <em>taken-for-granted</em> mindset. When you think about equity and valuation, you inherently think about money and becoming a millionaire.

I started to question <span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">why not</span> make <em>becoming a millionaire</em> a more active goal. It's not about making money more important to us, but more about where such a <span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">new mindset can take us to. </span>

It was kind of like that, when I was 21, working for a consulting company as a student and my mentor suggested that I should consider an MBA at Harvard in the future. 

<em>Harvardâ€¦me?!</em>

It was like striving for the stars. Only the really super smart ones go there and I certainly didn't consider myself in that league. But actually, it never even <em>occured</em> to me to strive for an MBA because I was <em>not even aware</em> that this was an option within reach in my life. So, I said <span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">why not</span> and tried and ended up working hard and earning my MBA and the rest is history...

<span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold">Asking <em>why not</em> defies established social norms we unconsciously adhere to.</span>

For those that are curious on how to tackle becoming a millionaire, here is how I actively build towards it:

<span style="color:#000000; font-weight: bold">Accumulate 1 Million in assets/wealth</span>

<ul>
<li>Build a balanced investment portfolio (see below post Part I)</li>
</ul>

<span style="color:#000000; font-weight: bold">Accumulate 1 Million in cashflow</span>

<ul>
<li>Get a good base salary </li>
<li>Have side hustles</li>
<li>Own shares in companies (business angel)</li>
</ul>

<b>Accumulate enough interest on wealth to live off it ðŸ˜„</b>
