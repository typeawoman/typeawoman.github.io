<br>
It makes it easier for consumers to choose amongst the mass. Likewise, we should think about our <em>personal</em> brand, because we should&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;make sure that we get&nbsp;remembered:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Our bosses should immediately think of us, when it comes to assigning the next really important project.&nbsp;Our network should reach out to us first, when they seek a certain&nbsp;expertise.</strong><br>
<br>
Because business is about people, and to advance and to succeed, what&nbsp;really matters is who we know and how we <em>personally</em> can add value (and our brand should convey exactly this).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size:16px">So:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;margin: 10px 0;padding: 0;mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #202020;font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 150%;"><span style="color:#d40202"><strong>What do you want to stand for?</strong></span></p>

<p style="margin: 10px 0;padding: 0;mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #202020;font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;"><br>
<span style="font-size:16px">As a generalist consultant, I always found it hard to "nail myself" on one field or function, but I realize that it wasn't about choosing one skill and voiding others, but rather <em>which skill I wanted to highlight and be remembered for</em>.<br>
<br>
<!--more-->So think about what you are good at, or what the 1 or 2 skills are that you want people to associate you with, ie. could be functional (digitization), or industry specific (transportation) or even a skill&nbsp;(singing) and see whether it feels right when pitching your own brand to yourself and then to your broader audience.<br>
<br>
As for me, my personal brand I am tackling right now is&nbsp;around <em>innovation and corporate innovation</em>. I want people to reach out&nbsp;when they want to build innovation labs, when they want to define an innovation processes or harness start-ups.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<u>And here is another good news:</u>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
There is now <em>real</em> potential to monetize your skill and brand </span>―<span style="font-size:16px">&nbsp;this is what has been coined the<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">Passion Economy</a></strong>&nbsp;(I can really recommend this article by Andreessen Horowitz!).</span><br>
<br>
We are moving away from the gig economy and the "Uber for X" era&nbsp;where standardized <em>work packages</em>&nbsp;are distributed amongst the mass and more towards a <em>unique knowledge and skills-based society</em>.<br>
<br>
What started out as influencers and influencer content on Social Media has morphed into a knowledge-based expert trend ―&nbsp;bloggers now earn $500,000 a year on <a href="http://substack.com/" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">Substack</a> and <a href="http://medium.com/" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">Medium</a>, teachers on <a href="https://www.podia.com/" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">Podia</a> and <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">MasterClass</a> make $100,000 a month with selling digital content subscriptions. And also don't forget the more traditional expert networks such as <a href="https://glg.it/" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">GLG</a> or <a href="https://thirdbridge.com/" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">ThirdBridge</a>&nbsp;which can earn you $500-$1,000 per hour.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Perhaps this could be the start of a wonderful side business?&nbsp;Anyways, here are some platforms that help to amplify individual&nbsp;skills and passions and may provide some inspiration for you:</p>
