<em>Why</em> questions are powerful.&nbsp;They ask for the motivation behind people's actions. <em>Why didn’t you speak up in the meeting? Why did you tell him?</em>&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<em>Why</em> questions have always been my favorite, because they&nbsp;let&nbsp;you get to the bottom of things.&nbsp;In almost all cases though, they&nbsp;tend to have an accusatory tone,&nbsp;pushing the other person into a defensive mode.<br>

<br>
For example, ask your boss: <em>Why do you want me to do this?&nbsp;</em>Well, don't do it. Your boss will definitely feel challenged.&nbsp;<span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold"><em>Why</em>&nbsp;leads to confrontation, even when you only wanted to understand better.</span><br>
<br>
<em>How</em> and <em>What</em> questions are better while literally asking&nbsp;the same:&nbsp;<em>Boss, <u>what</u> makes you suggest such an analysis?</em>&nbsp;<span style="color:#d40202; font-weight: bold"><They invite&nbsp;for more explanation and build empathy&nbsp;without putting the other person into a defensive&nbsp;position.&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
By the way, reformulating <em>why</em> questions into calibrating <em>how&nbsp;</em>and <em>what</em> questions are also HIGHLY EFFECTIVE&nbsp;in relationships.<br>
<br>
Instead of <em>why do you always come late</em>, ask <em>what makes it hard to be on time.</em>&nbsp;<br>
Instead of <em>why do you never call back,</em>&nbsp;ask <em>how come it’s hard for you to call me back</em>&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
Try it, it will work wonders.&nbsp;</span><br>
