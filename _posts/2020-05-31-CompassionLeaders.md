<br>
Perhaps it is boredom during lockdown,&nbsp;but I decided to<strong> </strong>start collecting great leadership speeches&nbsp;and dissect them&nbsp;to learn what <em>actually</em> makes them great.<br>
<br>
I have <span style="color:#d40202"><strong>a lot of respect for good writing and well performed speeches</strong></span>, which I find both such masterful skills to have. And secretly, I hope to consciously remember these speeches for when I may need to <em>write and give my own&nbsp;speeches</em>.<br>
<br>
If this is also of interest to you, I would love to have <span style="color:#d40202"><strong>you collaborate on this by sharing speeches you find&nbsp;interesting and tell us why you liked a certain speech. (Simply reach out to me).</strong></span><br>
<br>
By the way, I think the crisis is a fantastic time to find great speeches, because it is the time where societies, companies and teams all<span style="color:#d40202"><strong> need a bit of hope and encouragement</strong></span>.<br>
<br>
One that I came across recently&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://news.airbnb.com/a-message-from-co-founder-and-ceo-brian-chesky/" target="_blank" style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;color: #d40202;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underline;">speech</a>&nbsp;by Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb,&nbsp;who&nbsp;recently had to lay off 1,900 of its employees.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Here is what I believe makes this speech great<!--more-->:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Straight-forward</strong>&nbsp;- Brian doesn't go into long, laborious&nbsp;embellishments&nbsp;before getting to the core. He is&nbsp;to the point with no big fanfare&nbsp;</span><br>
	<em><span style="color:#d40202"><span style="font-size:14px">"When you’ve asked me about layoffs, I’ve said that nothing is off the table. Today, I must confirm that we are reducing the size of the Airbnb workforce"</span></span></em><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Transparent</strong> - Clearly articulate the process of how he got to this decision</span><br>
	<em><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="color:#d40202">"I am going to share as many details as I can on how I arrived at this decision, what we are doing for those leaving, and what will happen next. [...]"</span></span></em><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Reinforcing&nbsp;values</strong>&nbsp;- this is the most important&nbsp;I find too little leaders refer back to. Company values should be the guiding compass for tough time decisions<br>
	<em><span style="color:#d40202">"It was important that we had a clear set of principles, guided by our core values, for how we would approach reductions in our workforce. These were our guiding principles [...]"</span></em></span><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Sincerity</strong> - Messaging and tone coming from a sincere and honest place<br>
	<em><span style="color:#d40202">"I want to provide clarity to all of you as soon as possible. We have employees in 24 countries, and the time it will take to provide clarity will vary based on local laws and practices. [...]"</span></em></span><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Answers to unspoken questions</strong>&nbsp;- Anticipating what&nbsp;questions their employees may have<br>
	<em><span style="color:#d40202">"To take care of those that are leaving, we have looked across severance, equity, healthcare, and job support and done our best to treat everyone in a compassionate and thoughtful way."</span></em></span><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Caring</strong> - Showing respect and empathy, but not over the top that it appears exaggerated<br>
	<em><span style="color:#d40202">"I’ve asked all Airbnb leaders to wait to bring their teams together until the end of this week out of respect to our teammates being impacted. I want to give everyone the next few days to process this, and I’ll host a CEO Q&amp;A again this Thursday at 4pm pacific time."</span></em></span><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="mso-line-height-rule: exactly;-ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Addressing people directly at the end</strong><br>
	<em><span style="color:#d40202">"To those of you staying,&nbsp;<br>
	One of the most important ways we can honor those who are leaving is for them to know that their contributions mattered, and that they will always be part of Airbnb’s story. I am confident their work will live on, just like this mission will live on<br>
	<br>
	To those leaving Airbnb,&nbsp;<br>
	I am truly sorry. Please know this is not your fault. The world will never stop seeking the qualities and talents that you brought to Airbnb…that helped make Airbnb. I want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for sharing them with us."</span></em></span></li>

<span style="font-size:16px">In summary, I like&nbsp;that he acknowledged the bad situation, he provided clarity on the path forward and his&nbsp;speech comes across warm, sincere and empathetic without patrionizing, having pity or going into any excuses. It is really a powerful speech.</span><br>
